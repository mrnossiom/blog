# Introduction
<!-- takes the homepage intro and expands it -->

<!-- I started programming at ten with a wonderful book: Javascript for kids (Eyrolles). I did a lot of web development, done a discord bot in JavaScript (that I later rewrote in TypeScript for type safety and more fun). Likewise, I discovered Rust in 2021, and I think this is the most elegant system programming language we had until now. -->

# Stack

As of May 2024, the majority of the code I write for myself is Rust.

I know how to interact with relational databases (Postgres). I've already managed small RPI servers to host backends or services such as [OctoPrint]. Before I tasted `Nix`, I would use [Docker] a lot, even for local developement. I touched to [Terraform] to deploy to the cloud.

During my web period, I've read a fair amount of posts, online documentation, opinions and debates. I've had some experience with many JavaScript frameworks: [React], [Next] and [Vue]. I've been a big fan of typed languages, that's why I adopted [TypeScript].

Desktop-wise, I'm a proud [`NixOS`] user. I confidently know how to use CLI tools. I try to use as much open tooling as I can. It allows me to understand annoying behaviours and maybe contribute back to these open source projects.

To navigate and produce code, I use [Helix], which is written in Rust. Firefox is my main browser along with DuckDuckGo as my search engine.

I have less experience in writing those, but I can confidently read codebases in Python, Go.
