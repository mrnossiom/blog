# Introduction
<!-- takes the homepage intro and expands it -->

<!-- I started programming at ten with a wonderful book: Javascript for kids (Eyrolles). I did a lot of web development, done a discord bot in JavaScript (that I later rewrote in TypeScript for type safety and more fun). Likewise, I discovered Rust in 2021, and I think this is the most elegant system programming language we had until now. -->
