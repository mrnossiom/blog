# TL;DR
<!-- keep this part synced with homepage -->

I'm Milo, an 19 y.o. French student based next to Paris. I enjoy diving into complex parts of our everyday stack. That's why I like low level stuff, compiler, protocols and Rust ðŸ¦€.

In a sphere where sharing is key, [Open Source](https://opensource.org/osd) is important to me. Most of the tooling I use is *libre*, so I have the choice to take part to surrounding discussions or to inspect source code and suggest changes.

I write both technical articles and development stories. You can use the [RSS](/atom.xml) {{icon(icon="rss")}} feed to get updates.

# Stack

As of 2024, the majority of the code I write for myself is Rust.

I know how to interact with relational databases (Postgres). I've already managed small RPI servers to host backends or services such as [OctoPrint]. Before I tasted `Nix`, I would use [Docker] a lot, even for local developement. I touched to [Terraform] to deploy to the cloud.

During my web period, I've read a fair amount of posts, online documentation, opinions and debates. I've had some experience with many JavaScript frameworks: [React], [Next] and [Vue]. I've been a big fan of typed languages, that's why I adopted [TypeScript].

Desktop-wise, I'm a proud [`NixOS`] user. I confidently know how to use CLI tools. I try to use as much open tooling as I can. It allows me to understand annoying behaviours and maybe contribute back to these open source projects.

To navigate and produce code, I use [Helix], which is written in Rust. Firefox is my main browser along with DuckDuckGo as my search engine.

I have less experience in writing those, but I can confidently read codebases in Python, Go.
