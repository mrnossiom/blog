# Hi üëãüèª
<!-- quick introduction and link to in-depth bio -->

<!-- TODO: simplify and dedup with about -->
<!-- keep in sync with `about.md` -->
I'm Milo, an 18 y.o. French student based next to Paris. I enjoy diving into complex parts of our everyday stack. That's why I like (among others) low level stuff, compilers, protocols and Rust ü¶Ä. [Read more about me and my journey](@/about.md).

In a sphere where sharing is key, [Open Source](https://opensource.org/osd) is important to me. Most of the tooling I use is *libre*, so I have the choice to take part to surrounding discussions or to inspect source code and suggest changes.

I write both technical articles and development stories. You can use the [RSS](/atom.xml) {{icon(icon="rss")}} feed to get updates. You can also find me on the {{elink(content="Fediverse", url="https://elk.zone/fosstodon.org/@milomoisson", icon="fediverse")}}. Feel free to reach by mail at `milomoisson@gmail.com` or on _Discord_ {{icon(icon="discord")}} at `@mrnossiom`.
