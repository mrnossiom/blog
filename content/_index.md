# Hi üëãüèª
<!-- quick introduction and link to in-depth bio -->

I'm Milo, an 18 y.o. French student based next to Paris. I enjoy diving into complex parts of our everyday stack. That's why I like low level stuff, compiler, protocols and Rust ü¶Ä. [Read more about me and my journey](@/about.md).

<!-- +open source, cv -->

I write both technical articles and development stories. You can use the [RSS](/atom.xml) feed to get updates. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/milomoisson) and the [Fediverse](https://elk.zone/fosstodon.org/@milomoisson) or reach to me on _Discord_ at `@mrnossiom`.
